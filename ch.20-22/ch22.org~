** wrestling
Kit and Angie are watching TV in the basement. There watching wrestling. The peacock is challanging a Rockeweller to the championship when a manager walks and forces a match where he wrestles his partners. 






















Angie shakes her head and says, "I wonder how he's going to get out of this?" Kit looks at her and says, "I love watching it also but you do realise it's fake don't you?" Angie looks at her and says, "Those guys are real athletes I bet
any of those guys can take on a football player and win." Kit laughs and says, "After a two weeks of argueing then you have to order pay per view to see it" Angie turns off the TV because the show is off. She pulls out two tickets and
I was going to take you to see the amtch actually but since you hate it so much fine I'll ask Jacklyn" Kit laughs and syas, "Yeah that will stop the girl from hitting on you. Take her out on a date probably have sex after words. then 
expect her to leave you alone" Angie throws down a ticket and says, "Well if you want to go there. If not go to hell" Kit is smileing and says, "Angie, I told you I'm not going on a date with you until I fill comfortable that your not 
going to imabarese me" Angie turns and says, "It wasn't a date Kit. It was just two friends geting together and having fun. I don't even want you to dress up. Just wear you ammo party shirt" Kit smiles and says, "Why where you going to 
take Jacklyn. Angie replies, "That's the point"

Kit stops her at the top of the stairs and says, "Angie, I was just wondering. How did you afford those tickets? The bar closed down" Angie says, "I have lots in saveing plus I do get paid to work at the book store" Kit replies, "Well
what are you going to do. Your acting like it didn't even effect you. Your best friend was arrested for murder and your businees got closed down because of it" Angie shrugs and says, "So what. Kit when you work in a place like that 
alot of the people you know ain't going to be like they seem. We all knew Misty loved to torture men. She had a usual group that injoyed it. But other times she would trick new guys in for her fun. So killing people for hire ain't reallly
a shock" Kit leaves goes upstaris and says, "Well I'm hurt I really though she was a good person. She came to my rescue when I needed her, and she always helped people out. So I'm a little hurt that she had a drak side"

Angie walks up behind her and says, "Everyone has a dark side Kit. How about you? I mean you have injoy love being spanked and me calling you mommy. Also Iheard you let Josh piss on you" Kit looks and says, "Again go to hell" 

Kit oepsn the door to Mike's room and sees him on the bed geting head from a naked cat. A grey cat with black spots. that is also jacking off his own dick" Kit closes the door slowly adn says, "Ok Mike has a boyfriend now" Angie replies,
"Oh how do you know that?" Kit answers her, "Because Mike is geting a blow job from him" Just then the bed starts squeeking and they hear, "Damn" Kit and Angie leave a little shocked. Kit says, "I thought he was just saying he was gay"
As they make it to the stairs another cat fitting the man's discriptions walks past in a towel. She smiles at Kit and ANgie adn says, "Are you going to join? My brother always says the more the marrier" Angie shrugs and says, "WHy not"
Kit grabs her hand and says, "Because those are two strangres" The cat replies, "Oh you like the girlfriend experiance?" Kit blinks and sasy, "your a whore?" The cat rolls her eyes and says, "Please. Whores are cheap. I prefer to call 
myself a call girl. And my borhter is a escort" Kit wlkas down the staris and ahppily ANigie following. She looks at Angie and sasy, "I think we might need to have a talk with Mike" Angie replies, "Why?" Kit says, "Because he hired two
whores" Angie rolls her eyes says, "There excorts. They cots alot more" Kit confused asks, "Is there a diference?" Angie shrugs and says, "Not really but the more expensive ones hate being called a whore"

Kit sits on teh couch and says, "If people pay you to fuck there is something wrong with you" Angie laughs. Kit looks and sasy< "yes, there is something wrong with you if you fuck for a sandwhich" Angie repleis, "Hey I really love

something cute I'm going to wear for you" She smiles then runs her hand across Vickly's breast and says, "I have something that your large breast will look good in", smiling. Vicky laughs and says, "I  hope I'm not to sore to injoy it" 

Beth begins looking around and says, "Damn we're out of things to do" Vicky looks at her and says, "WHat now?" Beth looks down and says, "I'm a nervous wreck Vicky. I swore to myself that if for what ever reason I lost my job at the club
I'd open my own place. I'd go back into practice" Vicky smiels big and says, "Your going to open a shrink office?" Beth frowns and says, "Pschologist office, but yeah. come here" She takes Vicky's hand and pulls her to the bedroom where 
Beth opens a trunk and pulls out a rolled up peice of paper. She then takes it to the kitchen table and says, "I've saved up enough money to hire a crew to build me a nice office" She un rolls the paper and shows Vicky the layout.

A while back I got a idea for this and hired a drafter to turn a sketch into a usable blueprint.", Beth says while pointing to a large open room at the front the building. The room makes up at least three quarters of it. then in the back
is two rooms the same size. Beth points to the one on the right and says, "This will be my office and the other is the weighting room. The large room in the front will be a place for kids and adults that just want to come in and relax. 
They won't need a appointment just a place to play video games and watch some tv. Or sit at one of the many couches or chairs and text, read or just mess with thier phones" Vicky asks, "So what if kids and adults start fighting?" Beth 
replies with, "I'll have volunteers. Kids in their junior senior year of high school that needs their volunteer work and/or a job plus I'll have some security" Beth looks over it again and says, "Where are they going to use the restroom?"

Beth looks over the blueprint then says, "Damn it" Vicky laughs and says, "You'd thing the drafter would of pointed that out" Beht replies
