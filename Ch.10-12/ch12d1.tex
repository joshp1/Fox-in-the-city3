\section* {Chapter 12}
\subsection* {The big day}
	Angie wakes up with her head throbbing. She then says, "Damn blacked out at work. I ain't done that in years". She then looks around realizing where she is and sees the empty whiskey bottle and half drank one.\\

	She looks at the clock above the bar and says, "Fuck it's ten o`clock" She stands up quick but ends up running to the trash can and vomiting.\\

	Chase walks down and sees her on the floor and runs over to her. Angie looks up and says, "Could you turn the lights off?" Chase looks around and says, "Angie it's day time that's the sun" She hands Chase her phone and says, "Here call God and tell him to kill the lights", before throwing up again.\\

	He  helps her up and says, "Here lets get a cold shower and I'll get you some ibuprofen and water" Angie replies, "I prefer to shower alone right now. I need to get ready for Kit" she then feels her pants and says, "And why is my pants wet?" Chase considered says, "Angie no one is making you do this" Angie shakes her head and says, "I love Kit" then goes into her bathroom.\\

	In the kitchen Mike says, "Damn is she still drunk?" Chase gets the ibuprofen out and feels a big glass of water up and says, "No she just has a hang over from hell" Mike finishes his coffee and says, "Well what ever happens we're going to be eating good tonight" Chase frowns and says, "Mike our sister might be getting married soon, and all you can think about it food?" Mike smiles and says, "I know Kit really good. I know what she's going to say" He shrugs and says, "I'm getting ready for work"\\
